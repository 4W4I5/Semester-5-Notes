# Lecture 1: Introduction To Security
## Information Security

- Task of securing info that is digital.
	- Such as data that is:
		- Transferred on a storage device
		- Transmitted over a network
	- Ensure that protective measures are properly implemented to ward off attack and prevent the total collapse of the system when a successful attack occurs
	- Protect data in transit is the aspect covered in this course

#### Difficulties in defending against attacks

- Universally connected devices
	- Expansion in IoT
	- Can connect to a network of devices and takeover
- Increased speed of attack
	- Improvements in processor technology
- Greater sophistication of attacks
	- High level tools are already available, a newbie can start by buying off tools off of the dark web
- Availability and simplicity of attack tools
	- A lot of the heavy work is handled by the tools themselves therefore aiding the complexity of the attacks

## Defining Information Security

- Types of information protection
	- **Confidentiality** `How is this dependent on Integrity though`
		- Definition
			- Protect information from unauthorized access
		- Breaches
			- **Unauthorized Access:** Hackers or insiders gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
			- **Data Leaks:** Sensitive information is disclosed to unauthorized parties.
			- **Unintentional Disclosure**: Can be done so by sending a print of confidential data and someone else reads it, not encrypting data in transit, falling pray to a SE attack.
		- Countermeasures
			- **Encryption:** Converts information into a coded format that can only be deciphered by authorized parties.
				- Data in transit using IPSec, TLS, PPTP, SSH
				- Data at rest using whole disk and/or database encryption
			- **Access Control:** Restricts access to information based on user roles and permissions.
			- **Data Classification:** Categorizes information based on sensitivity and applies different security controls accordingly.
	- **Integrity**
		- Definition
			- Ensure Data Accuracy & Prevent unauthorized access (Dependent on Confidentiality)
		- Breaches
			- **Data Tampering:** Unauthorized changes to data, which could result in misleading or incorrect information.
			- **Data Corruption:** Unintended alterations to data that render it unusable or inaccurate.
		- Countermeasures
			- **Data Validation:** Checks data inputs for accuracy and validity.
			- **Checksums and Hashing:** Generates checksums or hashes to verify data integrity.
			- **Version Control:** Tracks changes to data and maintains a history of modifications.
	- **Availability**
		- Definition
			- Ensure authorized access to resources without disruptions
		- Breaches
			- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Overwhelms systems with traffic, rendering them inaccessible.
			- **Distributed DoS (DDoS) Attacks:** Coordinated DoS attacks from multiple sources, magnifying the impact.
		- Countermeasure
			- **Redundancy:** Duplication of critical systems and data to ensure availability even in the event of failures.
				- Example: RAID Array, Redundant data and power lines, software and data backups, Roll-Back/Failover.
			- **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across multiple servers to prevent overloading.
			- **Disaster Recovery Planning:** Establishes procedures and resources for restoring operations after a disruption.

## Protections to secure information

- ##### **Identification**
	- This involves uniquely recognizing users or entities accessing a system or resource.
- ##### **Authentication**
	- This verifies the identity of users or entities through credentials (like passwords, biometrics, tokens) before granting access.
- ##### **Authorization**
	- Once authenticated, users or entities are granted appropriate permissions to access specific resources or perform certain actions.
- ##### **Auditing**
	- The process of monitoring and recording activities on a system to detect and investigate security breaches or policy violations.
- ##### **Accounting**
	- This involves tracking and managing resource usage, often for billing, auditing, or security purposes.
	- **Non-Repudiation**
		- Ensure that the suspect of an event/activity cannot deny that the event occurred. It is essential to accounting and made possible through Identification, Authentication, Accountability, Authorization and Auditing

## Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) 
`Note these were made using chatGPT so bear w some inaccuraices for now`
## Sophistication
- **Advanced Techniques:** APTs utilize cutting-edge attack methods that are beyond typical cybercriminal capabilities. They might employ zero-day exploits, persistence, custom malware, and complex attack chains.
- **Custom Malware:** Attackers create tailored malware specifically designed to evade detection by traditional security measures. This makes it difficult for antivirus software to identify and mitigate the threat.
- **Precision Planning:** APTs are meticulously planned and executed. Attackers invest significant time in reconnaissance to gather intelligence about the target, its systems, and its vulnerabilities.
## Persistence
- **Continuous Access:** Once inside the target's network, APTs aim to maintain access over an extended period, often measured in months or even years. This allows them to gather valuable information and carry out their objectives over time.
- **Backdoors and Implants:** APTs create hidden backdoors and implants within the compromised systems. These serve as entry points for the attackers even if the initial point of entry is discovered and closed.
## Stealth
- **Anti-Detection Techniques:** APTs employ various techniques to evade detection, such as using encryption to hide their communication, disguising their activities as legitimate traffic, and employing anti-analysis mechanisms to hinder security researchers.
- **Avoiding Suspicion:** APTs aim to blend in with normal network activity, avoiding actions that might trigger alarms or raise suspicion.
## Specific Targets
- **High-Value Targets:** APTs often focus on high-value targets such as government agencies, military institutions, defense contractors, large corporations, and organizations with valuable intellectual property.
- **Nation-State Involvement:** APTs are sometimes attributed to nation-states, indicating political or espionage motives. However, some APTs also have financial or criminal motivations.
## Motivation
- **State-Sponsored:** Some APTs are believed to be backed by nation-states, aiming to gather intelligence, carry out cyber espionage, disrupt adversaries, or support political agendas.
- **Financial Gain:** Certain APT groups target financial institutions, critical infrastructure, and businesses to steal sensitive financial information, intellectual property, or engage in cybercrime for monetary gain.
- **Hacktivism:** APTs with hacktivist motives target organizations aligned with their beliefs or political objectives, aiming to create social or political disruption.

# Lecture 2: DNS Attacks

## Revising DNS & DHCP
- IP addresses allow internet connectivity
	- However tough to remember the IP for each website/server we need
- ### DNS
	- Mapping a memorable name to a routable IP Address
		- Also provides Next-Hop router, DNS ,gateway and host IP addresses
- ### DHCP
	- Setting IP address
	- PORTS USED:
		- 67 for server
		- 68 for client
	- Working (all are broadcasts)
		- DHCP discover
			- source IP = 0.0.0.0
			- destination IP = 255.255.255.255
		- DHCP offer
			- source IP = 1.1.1.254/24
			- destination IP = 255.255.255.255 (offer is also broadcast to all)
			- Server sends available IP addresses and options
		- DHCP request 
			- Requests IP from server after selecting from options
			- Basically check if the network has that IP already assigned by using the offered IP and ARP broadcasting
		- DHCP ACK
			- DHCP agrees final comms and ack the IP request
	- VULN
		- **Unauthorized Access**:
			- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the DHCP server, leading to various security risks and network disruptions.
		- **IP Configuration Manipulation**:
			- Attackers can manipulate DHCP to distribute incorrect or malicious IP configurations to clients, potentially disrupting network services and compromising security.
		- **Resource Exhaustion**:
			 - DHCP servers may run out of available IP addresses, causing connectivity issues, or face resource exhaustion due to DoS attacks.
		- **Network Traffic Interception**:
			 - DHCP can be exploited for man-in-the-middle attacks, enabling attackers to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
		- **Information Disclosure**:
			 - Poorly configured DHCP servers may leak sensitive information, potentially aiding attackers in exploiting network vulnerabilities.
		- **Option Injection**:
			 - Attackers can inject malicious options into DHCP responses, leading to DNS hijacking and traffic redirection.
		- **DHCP Snooping Bypass**:
			 - Failure to secure switches against rogue DHCP servers can allow attackers to deploy unauthorized DHCP services.
		- **Lease Time Manipulation**:
			- Attackers can manipulate DHCP lease times to maintain control over IP addresses for extended periods, facilitating persistent attacks.
	- Best security practices
		- DHCP Trusted Switches
		- DHCP Fingerprinting
		- Network Monitoring

## URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
`Used ChatGPT for this`
 - ### **Definition**: 
	 - A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a particular resource, either on the internet or in other contexts.
- ### **Types of URIs**:
    - #### **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: 
	    - A specific type of URI that provides the means to locate a resource on the web. URLs include the protocol (e.g., http://), domain, and path.
	    - **Components**:
		    - **Protocol**: Specifies how the resource should be accessed, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.
		    - **Domain**: The web address of the server where the resource is hosted (e.g., [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)).
		    - **Port**: Optional, specifies the port number to use for the connection (e.g., :80 for HTTP).
		    - **Path**: The specific location of the resource on the server's file system.
		    - **Query**: Optional, contains parameters for the resource (e.g., ?id=123).
		    - **Fragment**: Optional, specifies a specific section of the resource (e.g., '#section1').
	- **Example**: Here's a breakdown of a URL:
		- **URL**: [https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?param=value#section](https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?param=value#section)
		- **Protocol**: https
		- **Domain**: [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)
		- **Port**: 8080
		- **Path**: /path/to/resource
		- **Query**: ?param=value
		- **Fragment**:  '#section'
	- **Purpose**: 
		- URLs are used to uniquely identify and locate web resources, including web pages, images, documents, and more.
	- **Format Rules**:
	    - Should not contain spaces or special characters (use URL encoding).
	    - Use lowercase letters for protocol and domain (although it's case-insensitive).
	- **Encoding**: 
		- Special characters in URLs are encoded using percent-encoding (e.g., space becomes %20).
	- **Security**: 
		- URLs with "https" are secure, as they use SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission.
	- **Relative vs. Absolute URLs**: 
		- Relative URLs are based on the current page's URL, while absolute URLs specify the full path.
    - #### **URN (Uniform Resource Name)**: 
	    - Another type of URI that is used to identify resources by name in a particular namespace. URNs are intended to be persistent and location-independent.
- ### **Examples**:
    - **URL**: [https://www.example.com/resource/page.html](https://www.example.com/resource/page.html)
    - **URN**: urn:isbn:0451450523 (identifying a book by ISBN)
- ### **Purpose**: 
	- URIs are used to uniquely identify and access resources, whether they are web pages, documents, or other entities.
- ### **Components**: 
	- URIs typically consist of:
		- **Scheme**: Specifies the type of URI (e.g., http, urn).
		- **Authority**: Often includes domain or address information.
		- **Path**: Identifies the specific resource within the scheme's context.
- ### **URI vs. URL**: 
	- While URIs are a broader concept that includes both URLs and URNs, URLs are a specific type of URI that provides both identification and location information.

>NOTE:: Labwork took most of the time this is just extra info

1. **Basic Configuration**:
   - Configure the basic settings of your DNS server, including its hostname, IP address, and network settings. Ensure that the server is properly connected to the network.
2. **DNS Software Installation**:
   - Install and configure DNS server software. Popular choices include BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain), Microsoft DNS Server (for Windows Server), or other DNS server software based on your platform.
3. **Zone Configuration**:
   - Create DNS zones to define the domains and subdomains that your DNS server will be authoritative for. This may include setting up forward and reverse lookup zones.
4. **DNS Records**:
   - Add DNS records for the domains hosted on your server. Common record types include A (Address), CNAME (Canonical Name), MX (Mail Exchange), and NS (Name Server) records.
5. **Root Hints**:
   - Configure root hints or forwarders. Root hints provide a list of root DNS servers on the internet. Forwarders allow your DNS server to query external DNS servers for domains it cannot resolve locally.
6. **Security Configuration**:
   - Implement security measures such as DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) to protect against DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks.
7. **Firewall Rules**:
   - Configure firewall rules to allow DNS traffic to and from your DNS server, ensuring that it can communicate with other DNS servers and clients on the network.
8. **Testing**:
   - Test your DNS server's functionality by querying it for domain resolutions. Ensure that it can resolve local and external domain names correctly.
9. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Set up monitoring and logging tools to keep track of DNS server performance, potential issues, and security events.
10. **Backup and Recovery**:
    - Establish regular backup procedures for your DNS server's configuration and zone data. Create a plan for disaster recovery in case of server failures.
12. **Documentation**:
    - Document your DNS server configuration, including zone information, record details, and network settings. This documentation will be valuable for future reference and troubleshooting.
13. **Maintenance and Updates**:
    - Regularly update and maintain your DNS server software and configurations to ensure it remains secure and efficient.
14. **Client Configuration**:
    - Update DNS settings on client devices or on your network infrastructure to use your new DNS server as the primary or secondary DNS resolver.
15. **DNS Cache Management**:
    - If you wish to enable DNS caching on your server, configure cache settings to control how long DNS records are stored in the cache.
16. **Continual Monitoring**:
    - Continually monitor your DNS server's performance, resolve any issues that arise, and stay informed about security updates and best practices in DNS management.

### Iterated VS Recursive DNS queries
- Iterated
	- Exhaustively Iterates through all the DNS servers horizontally and then goes down a level
- Recursive
	- Server that is queried then takes the responsibility to get a response for the query back to the sender
### Aliasing & Load Balancing

### DNS Caching

### DNS Security
- DOS/DDOS
- Hijacking DNS
	- Threat Model and Attacker Goals 
	- Doesnt work now due to Bailiwick Checking, contextual updates only
- Kaminisky Exploit
	- PreReq is that local nameserver must not have the original website cached

# Lecture 3: TCP Attacks


- ### TCP 
	- Goal is to ensure reliability
		- Packets are delivered in order and unmodified
		- If packets are lost they are retransmitted

Started lecture 3 slides

### TCP Sequence numbers

- Unreliable in terms of security `Dont add much info for this`

## TCP Bytestream service

- The applications do **NOT** see:
	- Packet boundaries
	- Retransmissions
- Sometimes packets are out of order
	- Buffer out of order packets
	- Wait for retransmitted first packet

### TCP Handshake

- Used for establishing connection
	- Client sends SYN
	- Server sends SYN-ACK
	- Client sends ACK
### TCP SEQ & ACK numbers

### TCP Flags

### TCP Attacksp
- Syn flooding
	- sending too many SYN packets for the server to handle
	- Denial of service attack usually through sending SYN via multiple different IP
	- Prevention
		- Only create state after ACK is received 
		- SYN Cookies
			- 
	- Issue if spoofed ip is used
		- Person through which the spoofing is done, might delete their local state
			- A random ACK will trigger the RST flag to be sent in response`Pattern is wrong, check online`


TCP attacks continued


### Injection Attacks
- AKA Mitnick Attack
	-  `Fill in Case Study: MITNICK Attack `
	- Included in exam

---
# Chapter 6: Firewall
### Firewall Basics
- Runs a Policy based on a ruleset that passes/denies provable attack packets
- Policy
	- Group of rules that are bonded together i.e they can be updated together
- Rules
	- Allows/Blocks traffic In/Out of a specified single/range of ports
- Provable attack packets
	- Packet that met a firewall rule and got dropped after logging


## Firewall Characteristics
- ##### Traffic Overload
	- If a firewall is unable to examine and filter a packet, it is dropped i.e Firewall is being worked over its traffic capacity
		- Can be caused by complex rules that take up more processing time per packet
	- This is good for security however this results in a self-inflicted DOS
	- Filtering Mechanisms
		- Stateful Packet inspection filtering
			- `Fill in later from book`
		- Static Packet Filtering
			- Limits
				- Examines packets one at time
				- Only looks at some network and transport headers i.e checks the port and IP
				- Does not stop many types of attack
					- An isolated SYN/ACK packet which might be a part of a SYN/ACK flood attack will be let through
			- Benefits
				- Incoming ICMP echo packets and other scanning probe packets 
				- Outgoing responses to scanning probe packets 
				- Packets with spoofed IP addresses (e.g., incoming packets with the source IP addresses of hosts inside the firm) 
				- Packets that have nonsensical field settingsâ€”such as a TCP segment with both the SYN and FIN bits set
		- Network Address Translation - Next note
		- Application Proxy Filtering - Next note
		- Intrusion Prevention System Filtering - Next note
		- Antivirus Filtering - Next note
