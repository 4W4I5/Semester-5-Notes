# Differential Architecture

- ## Microkernel Architecture
	- A kernel usually has a few essential functions
		- Address Spaces
		- Inter Process communication
		- Basic Scheduling
	- Allows 
		- Simplifies implementation
		- Provides flexibility
		- Well suited to a distributed environment
	- `NOTE:: Filesystem types are deployed within the kernel`
- ## Multithreading
	- A process is which executes an application is divided into threads that can run concurrently
	- Thread
		- Dispatchable unit of work 
		- Includes a process context and its own data area to enable subroutine branching
		- Executes sequentially and is interruptible
	- Process
		- A collection of one or more thread and associated system resources
		- Programmer has greater control over the modularity of the application and the timing of application related events
