# Chapter 9: Uniprocessor Scheduling cont.

### Short term Scheduling Criteria
Main objective is to allocate processor time to optimize certain aspects of system behaviors
- User Oriented Criteria
    - Performance-Related
        - Turnaround time: The time it takes for a system to process a user's request and provide a response.
        - Response time: The time it takes for the system to react to a user's input or request.
        - Deadlines: Ensuring that the system meets user-set or system-imposed deadlines for tasks or processes.
    - Other
        - Predictability: The ability of the system to consistently perform within expected parameters, ensuring users can rely on its behavior.
- System Oriented Criteria
    - Performance-Related
        - Throughput: The rate at which a system can process and complete tasks or transactions.
        - Processor Utilization: Monitoring how efficiently the CPU is used, avoiding overloading or underutilization.
    - Other
        - Fairness: Ensuring that system resources are allocated fairly among users or processes.
        - Enforcing Priorities: Managing the priority of tasks or processes to ensure critical operations are completed first.
        - Balancing Resources: Distributing system resources effectively to prevent bottlenecks and maximize overall performance.
## Priorities
- Level assigned to an individual process/task running within a computer system
	- Determines the order in which processes are run within the system
- Unix and Windows handle priorities differently
	- Unix (Default used unless mentioned)
		- 1->N with 1 being the highest priority
	- Windows
		- N->1 with N being the highest priority 

### Priority Queues
- Ready queues are now made in order of priority
	- Dispatcher goes up in order of highest priority to lower queues until all processes from current queue processes are running
