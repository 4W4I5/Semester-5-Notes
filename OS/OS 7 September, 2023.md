### Why are we not so exact with numbers?
- Constants/Coefficients do no matter
- This is due to **Asymptotic Complexity** as N gets large, concentrate on the highest order term
	- This is due to the fact that time is linear in N
	- We can approximate the complexity of an algorithm
		- This is due to the fact that a lot of operations take varying amounts of time and are hardware-dependent
	- 
- Time complexity is shown as 
	- Big O
	- Theta
	- Omega
