# FreeIPA (OpenSource)
**Key Features:**
- Centralized Authentication: FreeIPA provides a centralized authentication and authorization framework for managing users, groups, and systems.
- Single Sign-On (SSO): It supports SSO, allowing users to access multiple services with a single set of credentials.
- Role-Based Access Control: FreeIPA allows you to define and enforce access policies based on user roles.
- LDAP Directory: It uses LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) for storing user and system information.
- Certificate Authority: FreeIPA includes a built-in Certificate Authority (CA) for managing SSL/TLS certificates.
- DNS and DHCP: It can manage DNS and DHCP services, simplifying network configuration.
### RedHat IAM

# Microsoft AD
- Used for SSO and Centralized user management
- Components
	- **Domain Controller**
		- A domain controller is a server that manages security authentication requests, enforces security policies, and stores information about objects in a domain.
		- It plays a central role in AD, authenticating and authorizing all users and computers within a domain.
	- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS):**
	    - AD DS is the core service of Active Directory that stores directory data and manages communication between users and domains.
	    - It includes features like user authentication, group policy management, and directory replication.
	- **Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS):**
	    - AD CS is used to create, validate, and revoke public key certificates.
	    - It is crucial for secure communication within the network and supports features like SSL/TLS for web security.
	- **Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS):**
	    - AD FS enables single sign-on (SSO) and identity federation across different organizations or systems.
	    - It allows users to access resources in a trusted manner without needing separate login credentials

# IAM Protocols
IAM itself is a framework to manage identities and controls access to resources
### Kerberos (SSO)
- Default Auth method used by Microsoft for AD (Active Directory) & Windows + Broadband providers.
- Widely used for network authentication.
- Kerberos operates on three main components or "heads":
    - Client/Principal: The user or entity requesting authentication.
    - Network Resource: The service or resource being accessed.
    - KDC (Key Distribution Centre): The central authority responsible for authentication.
        - Main trust provider for both the resource and the client/principal.
        - Maintains a database containing records of each client/principal.
        - Provides authentication services by granting tickets to client/principals.
- Weaknesses in Kerberos, Theyre mostly (MITM) attacks:
    - Pass-the-key: Attackers can impersonate authorized users by replaying their credentials.
    - Pass-the-ticket: Attackers intercept tickets sent to or from an authenticated user to impersonate them.
    - Golden ticket: Attackers can create a forged Windows domain controller ticket, granting credentials for unlimited access to application services.
    - Kerberoasting attack: This attack targets the encryption of service tickets.

### LDAP (Protocol to use w a Directory service like AD)
- Authentication method
	- SASL (Simple authentication and Security Layer)

### SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
- XML-based protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data used in web-based SSO.
- SAML enables a user to log in once and access multiple services without needing to log in separately to each one.
	- It enhances security by reducing the need for multiple passwords and simplifying user management.
- It consists of two main components: 
	- Identity Provider (IdP) 
		- The IdP is responsible for authenticating users and generating SAML assertions.
		- SAML assertions are digitally signed XML documents containing user identity information.
	- Service Provider (SP).
		- The SP trusts the IdP and relies on SAML assertions to grant access to users.
- SAML uses various bindings and profiles for different use cases, such as Web Browser SSO and Single Logout.
- **SAML Weaknesses** (GPT se uthaya)
	- **Complexity:**
	    - SAML is based on XML, which can be verbose and complex to parse, leading to increased processing overhead.
	- **Single Point of Failure (IdP):**
	    - In a SAML-based SSO system, the Identity Provider (IdP) becomes a single point of failure. If the IdP experiences downtime, users may be unable to access services.
	- **Limited Mobile Support:**
	    - SAML was designed primarily for web-based SSO, and it may not provide seamless support for mobile applications and devices.
	- **Cross-Domain Issues:**
	    - SAML was initially designed for use within a single domain. Extending it to work across multiple domains or organizations can be challenging and may require additional configurations.
	- **Complex Configuration:**
	    - Setting up SAML-based SSO can be complex, especially for organizations with numerous applications and services.
	- **Token Lifetime Challenges:**
	    - Managing the lifetime of SAML tokens can be challenging. Short-lived tokens enhance security but can lead to more frequent reauthentication.
	- **Limited Support for Modern Protocols:**
	    - SAML predates modern authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, which are more flexible and better suited for certain use cases.
	- **Resource Intensive:**
	    - SAML-based authentication can be resource-intensive due to the need for XML parsing and cryptographic operations, impacting system performance.
	- **Lack of Native Logout Support:**
	    - SAML lacks built-in support for Single Logout (SLO), making it challenging to implement consistent user logout experiences.
	- **Limited User Attribute Exchange:**
	    - SAML primarily focuses on authentication and may not provide robust mechanisms for exchanging user attributes between IdPs and SPs.

### MFA (MultiFactor Auth, also gpt)

### OAuth
- Hidden user creds
- Use for allowing 3rd party applications to access user data, social media login and securing API
- 3 main roles (Similar to Kerberos)
	- Resource Owner
		- User who owns data/resources
	- Client
		- app/service that wants access to the users resources
	- Auth Server
		- Manages user authentication and authorizes client creds

### OpenID Connect
