### RedHat IAM

# Microsoft AD
- Used for SSO and Centralized user management
- Components
	- **Domain Controller**
		- A domain controller is a server that manages security authentication requests, enforces security policies, and stores information about objects in a domain.
		- It plays a central role in AD, authenticating and authorizing all users and computers within a domain.
	- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS):**
	    - AD DS is the core service of Active Directory that stores directory data and manages communication between users and domains.
	    - It includes features like user authentication, group policy management, and directory replication.
	- **Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS):**
	    - AD CS is used to create, validate, and revoke public key certificates.
	    - It is crucial for secure communication within the network and supports features like SSL/TLS for web security.
	- **Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS):**
	    - AD FS enables single sign-on (SSO) and identity federation across different organizations or systems.
	    - It allows users to access resources in a trusted manner without needing separate login credentials

# IAM Protocols
IAM itself is a framework to manage identities and controls access to resources
### Kerberos (SSO)
- Default Auth method used by Microsoft for AD (Active Directory) & Windows + Broadband providers.
- Widely used for network authentication.
- Kerberos operates on three main components or "heads":
    - Client/Principal: The user or entity requesting authentication.
    - Network Resource: The service or resource being accessed.
    - KDC (Key Distribution Centre): The central authority responsible for authentication.
        - Main trust provider for both the resource and the client/principal.
        - Maintains a database containing records of each client/principal.
        - Provides authentication services by granting tickets to client/principals.
- Weaknesses in Kerberos, Theyre mostly (MITM) attacks:
    - Pass-the-key: Attackers can impersonate authorized users by replaying their credentials.
    - Pass-the-ticket: Attackers intercept tickets sent to or from an authenticated user to impersonate them.
    - Golden ticket: Attackers can create a forged Windows domain controller ticket, granting credentials for unlimited access to application services.
    - Kerberoasting attack: This attack targets the encryption of service tickets.

### LDAP (Protocol to use w a Directory service like AD)
- Authentication method
	- SASL (Simple authentication and Security Layer)
- LDAP is a protocol used for accessing and managing directory information services, often used for user authentication and directory services.
- It's lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for querying and modifying directory data.
- LDAP directories are organized in a hierarchical tree structure, with a root directory and branches called "entries."
- Each entry in an LDAP directory contains attributes (key-value pairs) that describe an object, such as a user or a device.
- Common LDAP directory services include Microsoft Active Directory and OpenLDAP.
- LDAP is commonly used for user authentication, enabling centralized login credentials for multiple systems.
- It follows a client-server model, where LDAP clients (applications) connect to LDAP servers to query or modify directory data.
- LDAP supports various authentication mechanisms, including simple bind (username/password) and more secure methods like SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer).
- LDAP is often used in conjunction with applications like email servers, web applications, and VPNs for user authentication.
- It's a critical component in many organizations for managing user accounts, permissions, and other directory-related tasks.

### SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
- XML-based protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data used in web-based SSO.
- SAML enables a user to log in once and access multiple services without needing to log in separately to each one.
	- It enhances security by reducing the need for multiple passwords and simplifying user management.
- It consists of two main components: 
	- Identity Provider (IdP) 
		- The IdP is responsible for authenticating users and generating SAML assertions.
		- SAML assertions are digitally signed XML documents containing user identity information.
	- Service Provider (SP).
		- The SP trusts the IdP and relies on SAML assertions to grant access to users.
- SAML uses various bindings and profiles for different use cases, such as Web Browser SSO and Single Logout.
- **SAML Weaknesses** (GPT se uthaya)
	- **Complexity:**
	    - SAML is based on XML, which can be verbose and complex to parse, leading to increased processing overhead.
	- **Single Point of Failure (IdP):**
	    - In a SAML-based SSO system, the Identity Provider (IdP) becomes a single point of failure. If the IdP experiences downtime, users may be unable to access services.
	- **Limited Mobile Support:**
	    - SAML was designed primarily for web-based SSO, and it may not provide seamless support for mobile applications and devices.
	- **Cross-Domain Issues:**
	    - SAML was initially designed for use within a single domain. Extending it to work across multiple domains or organizations can be challenging and may require additional configurations.
	- **Complex Configuration:**
	    - Setting up SAML-based SSO can be complex, especially for organizations with numerous applications and services.
	- **Token Lifetime Challenges:**
	    - Managing the lifetime of SAML tokens can be challenging. Short-lived tokens enhance security but can lead to more frequent reauthentication.
	- **Limited Support for Modern Protocols:**
	    - SAML predates modern authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, which are more flexible and better suited for certain use cases.
	- **Resource Intensive:**
	    - SAML-based authentication can be resource-intensive due to the need for XML parsing and cryptographic operations, impacting system performance.
	- **Lack of Native Logout Support:**
	    - SAML lacks built-in support for Single Logout (SLO), making it challenging to implement consistent user logout experiences.
	- **Limited User Attribute Exchange:**
	    - SAML primarily focuses on authentication and may not provide robust mechanisms for exchanging user attributes between IdPs and SPs.

### MFA (MultiFactor Auth, also gpt)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to provide multiple forms of identification before granting access to a system or account.
- It adds an extra layer of security beyond just a username and password.
- Common factors used in MFA include something you know (password), something you have (smartphone or hardware token), and something you are (biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition).
- MFA enhances security by making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access, even if they have your password.
- It helps protect against various cyber threats, such as password breaches and phishing attacks.
- MFA can be implemented in various ways, including SMS codes, mobile apps, hardware tokens, and biometric authentication.
- It's crucial for securing sensitive accounts and systems, especially in cybersecurity.
### OAuth
- Hidden user creds
- Use for allowing 3rd party applications to access user data, social media login and securing API
- 3 main roles (Similar to Kerberos)
	- Resource Owner
		- User who owns data/resources
	- Client
		- app/service that wants access to the users resources
	- Auth Server
		- Manages user authentication and authorizes client creds

### OpenID Connect
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0.
- It is designed for single sign-on (SSO) and identity verification on the internet.
- OIDC allows users to authenticate themselves and share identity information with third-party applications without revealing their passwords.
- It provides a standardized way to verify a user's identity using identity providers (IdPs) like Google, Facebook, or a corporate IdP.
- OIDC uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to encode identity information, making it easy to transmit and verify user data securely.
- It supports various authentication flows, including authorization code flow, implicit flow, and hybrid flow, to accommodate different use cases.
- OIDC is widely used in web and mobile applications for user authentication and authorization.
- It helps improve security by reducing the risk of password-related vulnerabilities and enables seamless user experiences across different applications.
- OIDC is commonly used in conjunction with OAuth 2.0 for securing APIs and resources.
