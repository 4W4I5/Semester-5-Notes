### Algo characteristics
- Definiteness
	- Steps must be precisely define
- Effectiveness
	- Individual steps are all do able
- Finiteness
	- It should not take forever to produce an output for any given input
- Output
	- Info/Data that goes out
- Other Important Feature
	- Input
		- Info/Data that comes in
	- Correctness
	- Generality
		- Works for many possible inputs
	- Efficiency
		- Takes less time & memory to run

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Platform Independence**
	- Ideal Algo has an elementary operation that takes 1 step and an instance that takes 1 unit of time
#### Analysing an Algo
- Simple Statement
	- Basic step = 1
		- as long as number of statements are constant
- Simple Loop
	- Basic step = N x 1
- Nested Loops
	- Basic step = i x j
	- Where i and j increment by one only
- Inner Loop depends on Outer Loop
	- Where Outer loop goes till N and inner loop goes till outer loop index
	-
