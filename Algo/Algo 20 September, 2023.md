## Divide & Conquer
- Divide the problem into a number of sub problems that smaller instances of the same problem
- Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. if the subproblem size is 
- Combine the subproblem solutions to form a solution to the original problem

### Recurrences
- Describes a function in terms of its value on smaller arguments (usually)
	- Mathematical way to divide and conquer
- If a recurrence is stated without a base case, assume its algorithmic
