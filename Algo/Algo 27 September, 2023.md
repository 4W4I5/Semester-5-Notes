Suppose you are given the following equation where a >=1 and b>1$$T(n) = aT\left(\frac{n}{b}\right)+f(n) $$ where $$f(n)=Θ(n^klog^pn)$$
- Note that you're supposed to do a reverse thingy and find powers of K and P yourself
- Structure of Values to note down
	- A, B, K, P
- Case 1 $$log_{b}a>k$$
	- Then $$Θ(n^log_b^a)$$
- Case 2 $$log_{b}a=k$$
	- Sub-cases
		- p > -1
			- $$If$$
		- p = -1
			- 
		- p < -1
			-
