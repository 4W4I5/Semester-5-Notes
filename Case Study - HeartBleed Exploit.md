## Mirai Malware Case Study

### Background
- Mirai is a notorious malware that targets Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
- It was first discovered in 2016 and gained widespread attention due to its role in massive DDoS attacks.

### Key Points
- **Infection Method**: Mirai primarily targets poorly secured IoT devices by using a list of default usernames and passwords.
- **Botnet Formation**: Once infected, devices become part of a botnet, a network of compromised devices controlled by the malware's operator.
- **Massive DDoS Attacks**: Mirai-infected botnets were responsible for some of the largest Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in history, causing widespread internet disruptions.
- **Target Selection**: The malware was used to target various online services, websites, and even critical infrastructure.
- **Source Code Leak**: In 2016, the source code of Mirai was leaked, allowing other malicious actors to modify and create their own versions of the malware.

### Notable Incidents
- **Dyn Attack (2016)**: Mirai was used to launch a DDoS attack on Dyn, a major DNS service provider, causing widespread outages for popular websites.
- **KrebsOnSecurity Attack (2016)**: The malware targeted the website of security journalist Brian Krebs, resulting in one of the largest DDoS attacks at the time.
- **Implication in Arrests**: The authors of the original Mirai malware were identified and subsequently arrested, leading to a significant reduction in the malware's activity.

### Impact
- The Mirai case highlighted the vulnerability of IoT devices due to lax security practices and the use of default credentials.
- It raised awareness about the potential for IoT devices to be used as tools in cyberattacks, emphasizing the need for better security measures.

### Lessons Learned
- IoT devices should never use default usernames and passwords.
- Regular security updates and patches are crucial for IoT devices.
- Security-by-design principles should be applied to all IoT devices during development.
- Collaboration between device manufacturers, service providers, and cybersecurity experts is essential to tackle such threats effectively.

### Continued Threat
- While the original Mirai authors were arrested, variations of the malware and other IoT-focused threats continue to emerge.
- The case study of Mirai serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges in securing the expanding landscape of connected devices.
