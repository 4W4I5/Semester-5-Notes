# NOSQL
To understand NOSQL we need to understand RDBMS i.e. the database management software we are used to (MS SQL Server or SSMS)

A standard project with a database system involves:
- Endusers that can
	- Request data through an application. Think of webforms in db lab project
- A DBMS
- A Database structure
	- Metadata for the tables created
	- Enduser data i.e. the tables we create

NOSQL stands for:
- NOT relational
- NOT RDBMS
- NOT Only SQL (IK i didnt get this either)
- Any database/datastore that isnt an RDBMS can be classified as NOSQL if it follows these rules:
	- Collection of several varied but related concepts on data storage and manipulation
	- Often related to big data
	- Class of products i.e mongoDB has atlas, and a whole lot of stuff

NOSQL was tailored for big data
**Data is considered Big Data**:
- When capacity is >= 1TB
- Has the following charecteristics
	- Greater Variety, less structure
	- Arrives in growing volumes
	- Arrives in growing velocity
- An example is social media, S3 solutions, need of dynamically-typed data with frequent schema changes
	- Data from the internet is massive and sparse, generally unstructured or semi-structured at best
### RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
- Manages and stores databases i.e multiple databases
- Consists of
	- Data utilities
	- Reporting
	- Access Control
		- Users
		- Policies
	- Storage Engine
		- Query Language with its own Query Processor
	- Monitoring
		- Logs
		- Performance
- Have ACID transactions
	- Atomic - All of the work in one transaction completes or none will
	- Consistent - Use of checks such as NULL or RANGE checks
	- Isolated - Results for changes are only shown when the transaction is committed i.e. completed
	- Durable - A system crash/other failure will not result in data loss of the transaction or at least the contents + context of the transaction.
		- Done by transaction logs that can recreate transactions from point of failture in time. Think of like snapshots in a VM
- **Shortcomings of RDBMS (Not suitable for big data)**:
	- These assume that data flowing in is
		- Largely uniform as in structured. The three types of data are:
			- Structured - Relational Data, tabulated
			- Semi-Structured - Loosely structured as in has a head and a body like html, xml, json, yaml, etc
			- Unstructured - Not completely unstructured but its just text explaining what the data is and/or images/audio
		- Scaling
			- RDBMS cant be distributed globally.
				- They were best designed to run on a single machine i.e. upgrades involve a lot of vertical scaling
			- Master-Slave Situation
				- All writes are written to the master
				- All reads are performed against the replicated slaves
				- Critical reads i.e. reads performed in real-time might be incorrect as it takes a while to propagate any recent writes
				- Large data sets take time to replicate
			- Sharding
				- A giant db is split into smaller db that each handles a subset of the original data. kind of like normalization but more abstract
				- Each shard operates independently as each shard has its own 'genre' of the data so that reads and writes only affect that specific shard
				- More relevant for NoSQL based servers
