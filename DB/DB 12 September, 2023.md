### Keys

- Keys as a Determinant
	- Key is a combination of one or more attributes that is used to identify a record related to an entity
	- based on a concept known as determination, it determines what attributes a (forgot, fill in with slides)
		- ROLLNUM in STUDENT would enable lookup of other attributes in the same record
	- Types of keys
		- **Primary Key (PK)**:
			- Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
			- Ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate or null values.
			- ADV:
				- Ensures data integrity by enforcing uniqueness.
				- Speeds up data retrieval operations, as searching by the primary key is typically faster.
		- **Foreign Key (FK)**:
			- Links a column in one table to the primary key of another table.
			- Establishes relationships between tables in a relational database.
			- ADV:
				- Maintains data integrity by enforcing referential integrity constraints.
				- Facilitates relationships between tables, enabling data consistency.
		- **Super Key**:
			- A set of one or more attributes (columns) that can uniquely identify a row in a table.
			- It may include more attributes than necessary to be a minimal unique identifier.
			- ADV:
				- Provides a way to uniquely identify rows, ensuring data integrity.
				- Useful for defining constraints and relationships.
		- **Candidate Key**:
			- A minimal super key, meaning it has the minimum number of attributes required to uniquely identify a row.
			- Often chosen as the primary key for a table.
			- ADV:
				- Speeds up searches as they are indexed and enforce uniqueness.
				- Offers flexibility in choosing the best attribute(s) for primary keys.
		- **Alternate Key**:
			- Candidate keys that are not selected as the primary key.
			- They provide an alternative means of uniquely identifying rows in a table.
			- ADV:
				- Provides additional options for unique identification.
				- Useful for different search criteria or scenarios.
		- **Composite Key**:
			- A primary key composed of two or more attributes.
			- Used when a single attribute cannot uniquely identify rows, but a combination of attributes can.
			- ADV:
				- Allows for complex, multi-attribute unique identification.
				- Enhances data integrity when a single attribute cannot guarantee uniqueness.
		- **Natural Key**:
			- A key that is based on existing, inherent attributes of the data.
			- For example, using a person's Social Security Number as a key in an employee table.
			- ADV:
				- Simplifies data entry and retrieval when using real-world identifiers.
				- Can make the database more intuitive for users.
		- **Surrogate Key**:
			- An artificial key generated by the database system, often as an auto-incrementing integer.
			- Used when there is no suitable natural key or to improve performance.
			- ADV:
				- Improves performance by avoiding the use of complex natural keys.
				- Guarantees uniqueness, even when natural keys are not available or practical.
		- **Compound Key**:
			- A key that consists of two or more attributes, but it may not be minimal like a composite key.
			- It's used to enforce uniqueness based on a combination of attributes.
			- ADV:
				-  Offers a way to ensure uniqueness based on a combination of attributes.
				- Useful for scenarios where no single attribute is sufficient for unique identification.
		- **Partial Key**:
			- An attribute that is part of a candidate key but not a super key by itself.
			- It contributes to the uniqueness of a row when combined with other attributes.
			- ADV:
				- Contributes to uniqueness when combined with other attributes.
				- Can be part of a candidate key to ensure data integrity.


## Terminology
- A **Relation** is a table with attributes
	- Has Attributes as Cols
		- A degree of a table is the number of attributes it might have
	- Tuples as Rows aka entries
- Relational Model Notation aka Schema
	- R(A1,A2,A3,A4,AN)
		- R = Relation Name
		- AN = Attribute name
	- Schema = Table Definition
		- Just write the RMN (Relational Model Notation) for that relation/table
	- Snapshot = Table State
		- Data stored within the table
- NOTE: A DATABASE includes ALL relations. So Database Schema and Snapshot will include ALL relations

### Characteristics of a Relation
- Each relation has a distinct name
- Each value in a tuple is atomic
- Each Attribute in a relation has a distinct name
- Values of an attribute are all from the same domain
- Order doesnt matter
- missed
- missed
