- Continuing Relational Models


### Keys
- Keys as a Determinant
	-  Key is a combination of one or more attributes that is used to identify a record related to an entity
	- based on a concept known as determination, it determines what attributes a  (forgot, fill in with slides)
		- ROLLNUM in STUDENT would enable lookup of other attributes in the same record
	- Types of keys
		- **Primary Key (PK)**:
			- Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
			- Ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate or null values.
		- **Foreign Key (FK)**:
			- Links a column in one table to the primary key of another table.
			- Establishes relationships between tables in a relational database.
		- **Super Key**:
			- A set of one or more attributes (columns) that can uniquely identify a row in a table.
			- It may include more attributes than necessary to be a minimal unique identifier.
		- **Candidate Key**:
			- A minimal super key, meaning it has the minimum number of attributes required to uniquely identify a row.
			- Often chosen as the primary key for a table.
			- Speeds up searches
		- **Alternate Key**:
			- Candidate keys that are not selected as the primary key.
			- They provide an alternative means of uniquely identifying rows in a table.
		- **Composite Key**:
			- A primary key composed of two or more attributes.
			- Used when a single attribute cannot uniquely identify rows, but a combination of attributes can.
		- **Natural Key**:
			- A key that is based on existing, inherent attributes of the data.
			- For example, using a person's Social Security Number as a key in an employee table.
		- **Surrogate Key**:
			- An artificial key generated by the database system, often as an auto-incrementing integer.
			- Used when there is no suitable natural key or to improve performance.
		- **Compound Key**:
			- A key that consists of two or more attributes, but it may not be minimal like a composite key.
			- It's used to enforce uniqueness based on a combination of attributes.
		- **Partial Key**:
			- An attribute that is part of a candidate key but not a super key by itself.
			- It contributes to the uniqueness of a row when combined with other attributes.
