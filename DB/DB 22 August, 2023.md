data = raw facts
data + context is information
e.g: 18 is data, adding a unit to this such as km/h or cm then it is information 

problems faced by ppl who used files for storage 30 years ago
- Data redundancy
	- slow update times
	- inconsistency

# Introduction
## Data:
- ### Terminology
	- Volume == amount
	- Velocity == speed
	- Variety == range of types and sources
- ### Types
	- #### **Unstructured**: No defined structure or organization
		- **Characteristics**: 
			- Varied, Complex and unorganized
			- Examples: txt files or media such as images, video and audio even social media posts
		- **Pros**
			- Enables capturing of diverse and rich information.
			- Well-suited for capturing human-generated content.
			- Can include valuable insights not captured by structured data.
		- **Cons:**
			- Difficult to process and analyze without preprocessing.
			- Challenging to search and query effectively.
			- Prone to inconsistency and lack of standardization.
	- #### **Semi-Structured**: Doesn't adhere to strict tabular structure but has some sense of organization
		- **Characteristics**: 
			- Flexible, Hierarchical and Tagged
			- Examples: JSON, XML, HTML or NoSQL
		- **Pros:**
			- Offers a balance between flexibility and organization.
			- Allows for easier storage and processing compared to unstructured data.
			- Well-suited for representing hierarchical and nested data.
			- Storing and exchanging data between systems with different protocols/schemes and webscraping
		- **Cons:**
			- Still requires some level of preprocessing for analysis.
			- Lack of strict schema can lead to data quality issues.
			- Querying might be more complex compared to structured data.
	- #### **Structured**: Tabulated data/High level of organization seen by rows & cols
		- **Characteristics**: 
			- Organized, Tabular and Standardized
			- Suited for SQL queries and Data analysis as it is stored in a relational model
		- **Pros:**
			- Easily organized in tabular format, suitable for databases.
			- Supports efficient querying using SQL or other structured query languages.
			- Highly suitable for quantitative analysis and reporting.
		- **Cons:**
			- May not capture the full complexity of real-world scenarios.
			- Limited in representing unstructured or loosely structured information.
			- Changes to the schema can be challenging and require careful migration.
