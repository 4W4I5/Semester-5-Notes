## Information Security
- Task of securing info that is digital
	- Transferred on a storage device
	- Transmitted over a network
	- Ensure that protective measures are properly implemneted to ward off attack and prpevent the total collapse of the system when a sucessful attack occurs
	- Protect data in transit is the aspect covered in this course

#### Difficulties in defending against attacks
- Universally connected devices
	- Expansion in IoT
	- Can connect to a network of devices and takeover
- Increased speed of attack
	- Improvements in processor technology
- Greater sophistication of attacks
	- High level tools are already available, a newbie can start by buying off tools off of the dark web
- Availability and simplicity of attack tools
	- A lot of the heavy work is handled by the tools themselves therefore aiding the complexity of the attacks
#### Next-Gen attacks
`Look at case study of DynDNS (Mirai malware). Write down a summary`
- Botnet? It is a prog hidden within the device and running in the background, provides resources to the attacker using other people's devices
	- Method of attack
		- Scan
			- Telnet scans
			- Look for IoT devices to find a route to target machine (enduser)
		- Infection
		- Control
		- Attack

#### Defining Information Security 
- Types of information protection
	- Confidentiality
	- Integrity
	- Availability
