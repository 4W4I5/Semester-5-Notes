		- Information
		- Customized Business Software
		- System Software
		- Physical Items
		- Services
- Threat
	- Actions or events that have potential to cause harm
- Threat Agent
	- Person/Element with the power to carry out a threat
		- Can also be natural disasters
- Vulnerability
- Threat Likelihood
- Risk
	- Situation that involves exposure to any sort of danger
	- Dealing with Risk
		- Risk Avoidance: Identifying the risk and not engaging in the activity to create that particular risk
		- Acceptance: Risk is acknowledging the risk exists but no steps are taken to address it
		- Risk mitigation: Address the risks to reduce the severity of the risks
		- Deterrence: Understanding the attacker and then informing them of the consequences
		- Transference: Transfer the risk to a 3rd party

## Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)

## 1. Sophistication

APTs are characterized by their high level of sophistication and complexity. Attackers behind APTs use advanced techniques, tools, and strategies that go beyond typical cybercriminal methods. These may include zero-day exploits, custom-designed malware, and carefully planned attack scenarios.

## 2. Persistence

Persistence is a key aspect of APTs. Unlike opportunistic attacks that aim for quick gains, APTs focus on establishing a long-term presence within the compromised environment. Once initial access is gained, attackers invest efforts to maintain access and control over an extended period, often measured in months or even years.

## 3. Stealth

Stealth is a crucial factor in APT operations. Attackers employ various techniques to evade detection by security solutions and network monitoring. They use encryption to conceal communications, leverage anti-detection tools, and create custom malware that remains hidden from traditional antivirus programs.

## 4. Specific Targets

APTs usually target specific organizations, sectors, or entities rather than indiscriminate attacks. Their primary focus is on high-value targets such as government agencies, defense contractors, financial institutions, and critical infrastructure. These chosen targets offer valuable information, intellectual property, or geopolitical advantages.

## 5. Motivation

APTs can have different motivations behind their activities:

- **State-Sponsored:** Some APTs are believed to be backed by nation-states and conduct cyber espionage to gather intelligence, monitor adversaries, or gain a strategic advantage.
- **Financial Gain:** Certain APT groups engage in cybercrime for financial profit, stealing sensitive data like credit card details or conducting ransomware attacks.
- **Hacktivism:** APTs with hacktivist motives target organizations that align with their ideological or political beliefs, aiming to disrupt or expose perceived injustices.

## 6. Advanced Reconnaissance

Before launching an attack, APT actors invest considerable effort in conducting thorough reconnaissance. They gather intelligence on the target's infrastructure, employees, technologies, and potential vulnerabilities. This reconnaissance phase helps them tailor their attack strategies for maximum effectiveness.

## 7. Customized Attacks

APTs frequently craft tailored attack strategies for each target. Rather than using generic methods, they customize their tactics to exploit the specific vulnerabilities and weaknesses they've identified during the reconnaissance phase. This customization increases the likelihood of success.

## 8. Multi-Stage Attacks

APTs often employ multi-stage attack campaigns. These campaigns consist of a series of interconnected actions, each building upon the success of the previous stage. By using various attack vectors, techniques, and stages, APTs can circumvent defenses and increase the complexity of detection.

## 9. Covert Communication

To maintain their presence and coordinate activities within the compromised environment, APTs establish covert communication channels. These channels can be encrypted and designed to mimic legitimate network traffic, making it challenging for security tools to identify and block them.

## 10. Long-Term Goals

Unlike typical cybercriminal attacks that aim for immediate gains, APTs have long-term objectives. These goals could include continuous data exfiltration, persistent surveillance, ongoing network manipulation, or positioning for future actions like disruption or intellectual property theft.

## 11. Evolving Tactics

APTs adapt and evolve their tactics over time to bypass evolving security measures. As security technologies improve, APT actors adjust their techniques to stay effective and avoid detection, making them a persistent challenge for defenders.
