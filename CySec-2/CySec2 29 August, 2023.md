## Cyber APT Kill Chain

#### 1. **Reconnaissance**
- **Description:** 
	- Attackers gather information about the target system or organization.
- **Activities:** 
	- Domain scanning, open-source intelligence collection, social engineering.

#### 2. **Weaponization**
- **Description:** Attackers create a malicious payload and pair it with a delivery mechanism.
- **Activities:** Crafting malware, creating exploit documents, preparing malicious links.

#### 3. **Delivery**
- **Description:** 
	- Attackers deliver the weaponized payload to the target's systems.
- **Activities:** 
	- Sending malicious emails, exploiting vulnerabilities, using compromised websites.

#### 4. **Exploitation**
- **Description:** 
	- Attackers leverage vulnerabilities to execute the malicious code on the target system.
- **Activities:** 
	- Gaining unauthorized access, privilege escalation, executing code.

#### 5. **Installation**
- **Description:** 
	- Attackers install persistent mechanisms to maintain control over the compromised system.
- **Activities:** 
	- Installing backdoors, creating user accounts, establishing command and control channels.

#### 6. **Command and Control (C2)**
- **Description:** 
	- Attackers establish a communication channel to control the compromised system.
- **Activities:** 
	- Setting up remote access, using encrypted communication, establishing communication protocols.

#### 7. **Execution**
- **Description:** 
	- Attackers perform malicious actions on the compromised system.
- **Activities:** 
	- Data exfiltration, lateral movement, privilege escalation, credential theft.

#### 8. **Persistence**
- **Description:** 
	- Attackers ensure their access to the system remains even after reboots.
- **Activities:** 
	- Modifying startup scripts, creating scheduled tasks, hiding in system components.

#### 9. **Privilege Escalation**
- **Description:**
	- Attackers increase their level of control and access within the target environment.
- **Activities:** 
	- Exploiting misconfigurations, leveraging software vulnerabilities, manipulating access controls.

#### 10. **Defense Evasion**
- **Description:** 
	- Attackers employ techniques to avoid detection by security measures.
- **Activities:** 
	- Anti-virus evasion, using encrypted communication, disguising malicious files.

#### 11. **Credential Theft**
- **Description:** 
	- Attackers gather authentication credentials to gain unauthorized access.
- **Activities:** Keylogging, pass-the-hash attacks, brute-forcing passwords.

#### 12. **Discovery**
- **Description:** 
	- Attackers explore the target environment to identify critical assets and data.
- **Activities:** 
	- Network scanning, system enumeration, identifying valuable data repositories.

#### 13. **Lateral Movement**
- **Description:**
	- Attackers move laterally within the network to access different systems.
- **Activities:** 
	- Exploiting trust relationships, using stolen credentials, leveraging lateral vulnerabilities.

#### 14. **Data Exfiltration**
- **Description:**
	- Attackers steal sensitive data from the target environment.
- **Activities:** 
	- Transferring files, compressing data, disguising data within legitimate traffic.

#### 15. **Impact**
- **Description:**
	- Attackers execute their primary objectives, causing damage to the target organization.
- **Activities:** 
	- Destroying data, disrupting services, deploying ransomware, causing financial losses.
