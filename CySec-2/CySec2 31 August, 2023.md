## Revising DNS & DHCP
- IP addresses allow internet connectivity
	- However tough to remember the IP for each website/server we need
- ### DNS
	- Mapping a memorable name to a routable IP Address
		- Also provides Next-Hop router, DNS ,gateway and host IP addresses
- ### DHCP
	- Setting IP address
	- PORTS USED:
		- 67 for server
		- 68 for client
	- Working (all are broadcasts)
		- DHCP discover
			- source IP = 0.0.0.0
			- destination IP = 255.255.255.255
		- DHCP offer
			- source IP = 1.1.1.254/24
			- destination IP = 255.255.255.255 (offer is also broadcast to all)
			- Server sends available IP addresses and options
		- DHCP request 
			- Requests IP from server after selecting from options
			- Basically check if the network has that IP already assigned by using the offered IP and ARP broadcasting
		- DHCP ACK
			- DHCP agrees final comms and ack the IP request
	- VULN
		- Malicious user can offer a IP to the requesting device and
